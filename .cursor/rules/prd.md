# PRD Consideration Rule

When working on any task or feature, always refer to the Product Requirements Document (PRD) located at `docs/prd.md`. This document contains all the essential information about the project, including:

- Timeline and release planning
- Technical stack requirements
- Core features and functionality
- User personas and scenarios
- Success metrics
- Implementation guidelines
- Out-of-scope features

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Always check if a feature is within scope of the MVP
2. Ensure all UI components use Shadcn UI for consistency
3. Follow the technical stack specifications
4. Consider mobile responsiveness in all implementations
5. Maintain security best practices, especially for authentication and payments
6. Keep the user experience simple and intuitive
7. Document any deviations from the PRD requirements

## Important Note

This rule serves as a reminder to always consult the PRD. For the most up-to-date and detailed information, always refer to the actual PRD file at `docs/prd.md`. The PRD is the source of truth for all project requirements and specifications.
